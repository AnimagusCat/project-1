# Project 1 - Serve Up!
It's time for lunch on the cruise ship and the vacationers are starving. These customers are fussy and will only eat a specific type of food. Serve the right order and you'll get your tip. Mess up even one order and you'll get a customer complaint. If you rack up three customer complaints, you're fired!
